### About me
My name is Bianca, I'm 19 years old, I currently live in Brazil and I am studying Software Engineering at PUCRS university. 
My contact with programming began in 2015, through social educational robotics projects and FIRST competitions.
I am curious about everything involving technology and determined to learn new things, however, at the moment I am most interested in the areas of game development, algorithm analysis and back-end development.
